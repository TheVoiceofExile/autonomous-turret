## Vision Statement :eyes:
The auto turret provides a peace of mind to security-conscious individuals of all ages including, college dormitory students, retired individuals, also young-adults who are tired of their family members entering their private areas without permission. It accomplishes this via alerts whenever it is triggered. The auto-turret also provides a high-level of entertainment with its nerfs and witty LCD text warnings.

The auto-turret increases your peace of mind, by reducing theft. The turret does this by being able to track and warn would be intruders.  Intruders in a certain range will be fired upon. The auto-turret will amuse its owners and friends with its compact design and can be used in games and activities while also preventing unwanted intruders inside your space.

The auto-turret will be deployed with certain abilities. The auto-turret will accurately track movement with multiple sonar sensors measuring anything that moves too close. The auto-turret will be able to scan its area and determine if anything has moved within its space. The auto-turret will differentiate between a safe distance, warning distance, and firing distance. The auto-turret will display audio-visual warnings while in the warning zone and before firing. Upon detecting movement, the auto-turret will log status updates that inform the owner of anything it detects, the distance itâ€™s detected at, the time it was detected, and whether it fired upon the detected object. The auto-turret will communicate over Ethernet or wifi to the internet and store detection logs to a database. Users will be notified electronically on the web or on their cell phone with status updates on any detections made by the auto-turret.
